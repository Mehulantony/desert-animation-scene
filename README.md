# Desert Animation Scene using Python and cs1graphics module

## A brief summary of the project

###### This Python project creates an animation scene by using the cs1graphics module
###### which helps us to develop a graphics scene and then animate it. In the scene,
###### we have a sun, cloud, cactus and two camels. For the complex objects such as the
###### cactus, cloud and camel, we use the Layer class to combine multiple primitive objects.
###### The initial scene consists of the cloud moving, after which a camel moves a certain distance 
###### and stops, followed by another camel entering the scene and exiting.

&nbsp;  

###### Key features of this project include graphics creation, object-oriented design and event-driven animation.
